Hi there, my name is Alexandra Coffman!

I’m currently studying Computer Science and Digital Narrative & Interactive Design with a minor in Information Science focused on UX at the University of Pittsburgh. I derive immense joy from crafting thoughtful and immersive user experiences. I also believe that design and programming can’t thrive without each other; design needs functionality, and programming needs a neatly crafted, user-friendly appeal. I love creating magnificent creative designs and using code to bring those stories to life.

Beyond designing and coding, I’m someone who finds peace in the rain, the coziness of vibrant, warm fairy lights, and magic in a good book. 

Right now, I’m looking for a full-time opportunity in UX engineering or product design, where I can merge my creativity and technical skills to build meaningful, delightful experiences.

Let’s build something beautiful, functional, and full of heart.
